# BP-statistical-review-2020

The project aims at using Python to extract clean data from the an excel workbook that has multiple datasheets.
The Excel workbook is the Annaul BP statistical review on World Energy. 

**NOTE** : BP was contacted to ask for permission of using their publicly available statistical review for the work.

The goal is to get data extracted in a clean formate using pandas from one Excel worksheet, then generalize over the entire Excel Workbook and, finally, benchmark the results between different energy scenarios as a way to show how to benchmark time series data.

* Extracting data from multiple excel sheets (BP statistical review_reading Excel workbook_function and extract multiple sheets.ipynb)
* Benchmarking energy scenarioes (time series data) (BP statistical review_benchmarking.ipynb)
